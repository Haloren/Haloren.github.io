For my JS-Rails project I finally got a good taste of some front-end development and let me tell you it is by far the best thing I have experienced so far. So far so much has been on concepts and how things work under the hood you don’t get to actually experience or interact with the glitz and the glam. But for this project I probably spent more time watching tutorials on all the crazy and awesome things Javascript can do and the different projects that can be made with just HTML, CSS, and Javascript then actually coding. Honestly it was hard to stay focused and make a to do list that I could stick to to get my project completed. Not to say it was all peaches and cream though. Setting up the Rails back-end was the key to it all, I dropped, broke, and rebuilt my database to get the correct format that would support my single page application (SAP) with the help of serializers all the data I wanted was now accessible. 
From here on out it was looking up syntax and playing around in the browser which is absolutely the best thing ever, clicking on the line you want to add a debugger to in sources and being able to test code right in the browser, often with the code seeming to just write itself (thank you Chrome), was the most amazing thing I’ve seen in awhile. Needless to say being able to visually see everything in action as you do it is the future for me.
Okay, well now back to the project. I created a “pictionary” type game that that includes the ability to add and remove players, keep player scores, a game timer, random words pulled from a database and the ability to toggle cover/hide the cards, and a HTML5 canvas (still working out some of the bugs on the canvas to be honest, canvas resizing is definitely an issue).
Here’s a YouTube demo if you’d like to check it out: https://youtu.be/XPEXFG_qAw8 (Video is less than 2 mins long).
