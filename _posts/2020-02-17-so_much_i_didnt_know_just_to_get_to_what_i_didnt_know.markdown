And here we go.

Now if that wasn't a vague title, I don't know what is, no actually I probably don't. My brain might have stopped working at some point and is re-loading slower than 'bundle install' after I crashed my program for the hundredth. That's about how this week went, so much uncertainty and so much to learn I feel like my head might explode.

And we move forward.

Or should I say that's the first time I fell on my face. You might think we have made it to the project now, well not quite. We still have to set up this blank canvas and get some paints, and brushes, and I barely know what those things look like, and typing 'learn' into the IDE is no longer an option. It's just a memory now, a comfort that you use to curse. 

And we realize we're old.

Starting this journey at almost 40, I felt like the world had prepared me for so much already, but what I failed to realize is how much the world had actually evolved and advanced. Blogs, vlogs, screen recording, googling as a skill (this should be a weeklong course), data, information, more data, and unlimited tools to sort through it all, it's a whole new universe. My previous work experience was in various roles in medical device production and sales, and oh how far behind that world is from this one.

And we began asking.

And asking, and asking, and thankfully my instructor (Morgan did I say thank you today? Well if you read this: Thank you.) and my classmates (I'm pretty sure they're mostly made of rocket scientist) kept answering my questions and patiently waited for me to wind up my brain again and again to move on to the next step.

And we haven't even started the project yet.

So, at this point, it was day 2 in the week and my questions would exponentially grow each day from here on out. Also, my first line of code wasn't even written yet in the IDE, I had a few outlines, but no way of actually knowing if it was, letâ€™s say viable? Now the fun began, and a critical question wasn't asked (probably because everyone else already knew this): Are scraping and an API the same thing? Apparently not, but both provide you with data and that's what was more important. So, I tried scraping first because there were more resources and video walkthroughs on how to do this, and I failed, got frustrated and then tried an API. Got help and attempted to use an API.

And then we became intimidated and turned around.

This was my first BIG mistake. I really should have stayed the course and worked with my API more, especially since it had all the data right there, but it was hard to visualize. So I started writing code and pulling data, lots and lots of unorganized data, what a mess, and as it was starting to form (I didn't realize this then, but looking back now and I kick myself for not continuing), I learned I had to "hide" my API key and something about DotEnv (still not entirely sure how to use this) and then to Google I went and became confused. So out I started reaching to others, to find out almost everyone else was scraping, so that must be the path, because I felt like I was walking through a cactus patch.

And break..... down...... through?

Well I definitely broke and broke and decided to started over and broke it again and broke down and then realized, this isn't breaking, this is progress. Like building muscle you have to tear and repair. And each time your muscles repair, they become strong...... you become stronger, more capable..... and so does your code.

And so, we're here.

So I decided to focus my blog on the journey and maybe I'll write a second one exploring the concepts I'm learning more (like iteration), or maybe even get really fancy and make a Vlog, especially now that I have uploaded my first video to the internet (YouTube you're not as easy to work with as you think). Look I even used pictures (gifs) in this blog, well I hope they turn out, even if they don't it's still progress because I'm trying something new, they better turn out.

And that's all for now.
