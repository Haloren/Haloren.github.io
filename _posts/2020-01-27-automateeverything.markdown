Kyle R. McKenna has worked a plethora of jobs. (Oh great this as-hat just referred to himself in the third person) 
With "job" being the key word. 

"Job" : not a passion, not a career, and definitely not a lifestyle, but a job can pay some bills.

So off to work I went. Off to "job"s in: manufacturing, real estate, construction, call centers, finance, medical, and I think you get the picture. And the one thing these jobs all had in common was doing repetitive tasks with strict guidelines, standard operating procedures, and/or scripts. I was serving as a terminal to pass one person's information to another. This left me to realize all these tasks would be more efficient if I wasn't here; not to mention be more cost effect for the company and more accurate for the person requiring a product/service. 
I was a "middle-man" ("man" being the key word here, outdated, because forward thinking and the future has people, not just men), and everyone around me also "middle-men" with layers of management and middle management to boot. All that energy and time may have once been the only way, but the future is now and all this can and needs to be updated. With the power of machines and connectivity of the internet we can allow people to be direct and save everyone from having to suffer an adult version of the elementary school game telephone. So much is lost or changed the longer the chain of information is and the longer the chain of middle-men it passes through. "Taking an Order" can now be changed to "Making an Order" and provide more accurate, faster, and less labor intensive products.
 
So why did I start this path? Why did I form all that build up? Well, I hope coding can help me strive toward removing human interaction, where human interaction is not needed.... so humans can actually interact and progress toward new ideas (or update old ones). And remove the focus of human control over each other to perform repeative tasks.

Maybe we'll just say:
"My goal: Automate everything we can."
